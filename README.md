CitizenLink â€“ Citizen Engagement System

**CitizenLink** is a digital platform designed to improve how citizens interact with their local governments. It enables citizens to easily submit complaints or feedback on public services, which are then categorized, routed, and tracked by local leaders at different levels of governance (Cell, Sector, District). The system promotes transparency, responsiveness, and accountability in government service delivery.


### For Citizens
- Submit complaints or feedback on public services via a web form
- Select the appropriate **governance level** (Cell, Sector)
- Receive responses and updates via **email**
- Track the **status** of their submissions (e.g., Pending, Solved)

 ### For Leaders (Cell/Sector/District)
- Login with credentials received via email
- View all submissions assigned to their level
- Mark cases as **solved** and respond with descriptions
- View individual case details

### For Super Admin
- Login with default credentials:
  - **Email**: `admin@gmail.com`
  - **Password**: `admin`
- Create and manage accounts for Cell, Sector, or other leaders
- Automatically send credentials to leaders via email
